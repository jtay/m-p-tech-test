# Mamas & Papas Tech Test

*Frontend Developer test brief implemented into a Shopify OS2.0 Section*

### Candidate notes

I have presented the finished product as a Shopify theme section. Users can choose a custom GraphQL endpoint, access token and quantity of products to query.

Prior to implementation, I designed the following [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/LBLyW1EBhy9oXoFriK2CcY/M%26P-Tech-Test?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=qvKVTJde6A2uYQvk-1) to use as a guide during development.

### Steps to test

1. Upload entire repository to Shopify Admin Themes page as a zip file
2. Open theme in Shopify Theme Editor
3. Choose **(JT) Featured Products** from the Section List
4. Save changes in Shopify Theme Editor
5. View on published site, or preview in-browser (Fetch Products button doesn't work in Theme Editor)
